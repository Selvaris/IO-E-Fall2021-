Project 2
All of my sprints were based off of tutorials given, mainly the three sensors one. The first one was modified to mimic a rising sun on a skyline, which grew in size as the sky lightened. The second one used the mousePressed function to start and pause a song, while the background used a particle system from a previous project. The third one slightly altered the Oscillate tutorial from the p5js website, and the final one utilized all three sensors.
